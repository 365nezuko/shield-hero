The Rising of the Shield Hero (盾の勇者の成り上がり Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari?)​​​​ is an anime series by Kinema Citrus based on the light novel series of the same name by Yusagi Aneko. The worldwide premiere of episode 1 of The Rising of the Shield Hero anime debuted at Crunchyroll Expo on September 1st. The Crunchyroll co-production will be available to members worldwide except for Asia when the series kicks off as part of the winter 2019 anime season.

## Synopsis

Stories of old tell of four otherworldly heroes—wielding the sword, spear, bow, and shield—who defended the land from wave after wave of calamity. With the fate of the world in balance, the kingdom of Melromarc summons these legendary figures; in modern-day Japan, the call is answered, and the unwitting heroes are transported to this fantasy universe.

Thrust into Melromarc and given the title of "Shield Hero," otaku Naofumi Iwatani is labeled the weakest due to his lack of offensive capability and apparent inexperience. When the heroes part ways to start their journeys, he only has one willing companion: the beautiful princess Malty Melromarc. However, she soon betrays him, steals all his money, and accuses him of taking advantage of her. 

For his alleged crimes, Naofumi is branded a criminal and made an outcast of society. With hatred filling his heart, he sets out alone, vowing vengeance against those who wronged him.
