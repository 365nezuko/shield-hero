## Barbarian Armor

The Barbarian Armor was crafted by Erhard specifically for Naofumi with agility and defense in mind in preparation to his first wave of disaster. It is similar in quality to the Chain Mail he purchased on the first day he was summoned, but can also be upgraded. It is made of cheap copper and iron as well as Pill Rabbit and Porcupine hides, and a few Pikyu Pikyu feathers. The Pill Rabbit hides make up the fluffy wool portion around the neck, while the chest area is a metal plate. The joints aren't connected with metal ingots, but instead, Porcupine skins are used. The Pikyu Pikyu feathers can be felt well since they are stuffed full between the duel skin layers. It is similar to the type of armor bandit lords would wear and has a wild vibe. Found in『Chapter 17』of the web novel.

## Barbarian Armor + 1

In preparation to the third wave, Naofumi asked Elhart for new weapons and Armor. Elhart stated he needed additional materials in order to improve Naofumi's current equipment so Naofumi offers the remnants of the Chimera and Zombie Dragon he had recently slain. With the new materials, Elhart was able to upgrade the Barbarian Armor into Barbarian Armor +1 and charges Naofumi a 5 gold service fee.

The Chimera and Dragon bones were turned into a powder to reinforce the internal parts and their skins were worked to create strong, elastic clothes which resemble "Hokuto no Ken clothing Mark 2". The metallic parts now are smaller but more resistant and the armor has a core/gem inherited from Zombie Dragon. The overall look remained similar.

The armor has two forms according to the color of the gem. In the basic form the color of the gem core is purple, but, when resonating with other pieces of former dragon heart, became red, resembling the eye of the dragon. The entire armor transforms itself turning into a jet black dragon. Found in『Chapter 51』of the web novel.

## Penguin Plush

The Penguin Plush is a suit of armor similar to the Filo Plush however it's stats are significantly lower. The Penguin Plush is a Penguin-resembling doll wearing a Santa Suit that is acquired through a Karma Penguin drop. Its purpose is the same as a suit of armor with some additional abilities and perks. It can conform to the user's size but will transform them into a penguin-like creature. Its defensive abilities are slightly better than that of Naofumi's Barbarian Armor +1 and it is Filo's designated sleepwear. Rishia also wore one to compensate for her lower level after joining Naofumi's party however she upgrades to the Filo Plush soon after. Found in『Chapter 107』of the web novel.

## Filo Plush

The Filo Plush is a suit of armor similar to the Penguin Plush however its stats are far superior and it also gives the wearer the Filolial Shield bonuses (growth correction) because of the Race Change Ability contained. This is a unique item made by Elhart using items and materials collected from Cal Mira Archipelago and inspired when Filo and Melty were playing nearby. Found in『Chapter 115』of the web novel.

## Barbarian Armor + 2

After the fierce battle with the Spirit Tortoise, Naofumi's armor was damaged beyond the armor's 「Autonomous Repair」ability. Naofumi took it to Elhart for repairs. During the time it was being repaired, an incident occurred with Gaelion causing Naofumi to lose the core he was holding that used to be embedded within the Barbarian Armor + 1. After the said incident, Gaelion replaced the lost core with another that he somehow coughed up. The new core makes the armor lighter and gives a number of additional bonuses, however, the armor loses its「Darkness Resistance (High)」. Found in『Chapter 215』of the web novel.

## Barbarian Armor + 2 (Cursed)

After the fierce battle with Kyo and the Spirit Tortoise, Naofumi's Barbarian armor +1 was damaged beyond the armor's「Autonomous Repair」ability and ceased to function due to crossing worlds. Naofumi left it to Romina, the jewel blacksmith, to make a new armor based on it. it's made using materials from the 4 holy beasts. Romina also found a way to merge the pieces of the armor's dragon emperor's core with a few pieces from her world. The new core is bigger and gives a number of additional bonuses, however, the armor loses it's Darkness resistance effects. As soon as it's worn, the armor curses the wearer and damages them. However, Naofumi's defense was high enough to ignore the damage, making it feel somewhat tight in some spots. Found in Vol 9 of the Light Novel.
