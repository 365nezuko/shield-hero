## Firearms

Firearms were proposed as weapons by many of summoned heroes, but most of their attempts failed due to the many factors that affect their performance in this world. Bullet speed is and power affected by the user's Status and there are various problems involving reloading, regulating gunpowder, and the like. Although fire magic can discharge the bullet, one can accelerate bullets using gunpowder but the damage isn't particularly high. In comparison to a bow, its maintenance and ammunition costs are much higher, so they aren't really used outside of Faubley. If one wants to attack at long distance, most would use a bow, magic, or a throwing weapon. Like in reality, if one shoots from too far away, the output drastically drops. If trained properly one can get quite strong, but it wouldn't be the strongest weapon. The conclusion is that firearms probably aren't as useful as they are in the Heroes world.
