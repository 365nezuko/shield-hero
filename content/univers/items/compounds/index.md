Compounds are items that are typically created through a skill called "Compounding" and can be created manually or through the use of a Legendary Weapon. Although many compounds can be made through the use of a Legendary Weapon, all products of the Legendary Weapon will be normal quality despite the input ingredients. (Using any low, mid, or high quality ingredient will result in normal quality products). Some naturally occurring plants share the same use or effect as certain compounds so they can sometimes be used as a substitute and are therefore included here as well.

## Medicine of Miracles

The Medicine of Miracles, also called Yggdrasil, is capable of curing most illnesses and boosting energy. Simplifying the compound, it's sap from a Sacred Tree. The medicine required ointment, magic water, soul healing water and a few others ingredients to be mixed together into a supernatant fluid with the toxic parts being filtered by exquisite distribution. The medicine could only be made once at the time due to the ingredients it costs and the risk of failure. Although the Spirit Tortoise Sacred Tree Shield assists in the creation of the medicine, it is so difficult to make that Naofumi could barely make one, even with the help of his shield. It is first referred to after the Zombie Dragon incident when it was used on the Old Hag that assisted in defending the village from the wave. The first time Naofumi created it he used it on Atla to cure her hereditary illness. It is an extremely valuable medicine. Found in chapter 『Chapter 158』 of the web novel.
