# Description
### Summoning & Selection

Legendary Heroes and Vassal Wielders are summoned along with their weapons through summoning rituals performed by the natives however it's not uncommon for summoning rituals to fail, summoning only the weapon. Granting the ability for anyone to wield the weapon if they have the potential, this however only applies to the Vassal Weapons.

When a Hero passes on, they will have no longer have ownership of the weapon. Legendary Weapons will disappear in wait to be summoned with a new hero while Vassal Weapon will choose to roam the world or stay in a particular location in search for a new candidate to wield them.
