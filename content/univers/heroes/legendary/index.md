The `Legendary Weapons` (伝説武器 Densetsu Buki?) are summoned and wielded by the `Four Legendary Heroes` from another world. They are also referred to as the `Four Heavenly Weapons` (聖武器 Seibuki?) since many religions formed centering around the `Legendary Heroes`.

# History
## Origins

The origins of the Legendary Weapons are still unknown. It is speculated that the Vassal Weapons have a deep tie with the Legendary Weapons and the origins of the world.

Their objective is to defeat the current set of Waves of Calamity, after which the users are allowed to resign back to their worlds.

## Legends

Legendary Weapons are summoned in response to the waves, appearing in sets of unique weapons, usually four in total. The summoning ritual will also select people from other worlds to wield these weapons; in Naofumi's case, he encountered The Record of the Four Holy Weapons while browsing the library. Once a Legendary Hero is deceased, their weapon will disappear in wait to be summoned again with a new hero. The weapons can be resummoned if either the current set of waves is vanquished, or the set of weapons is expunged. With each weapon missing, the waves are said to grow stronger.

Legendary Weapons specialize in protecting the world they reside in. They upgrade through adventuring within their respective worlds, with each world having different power metrics.

All weapons possess a gem that acts as the functional matrix to activate abilities, this gem persists through transformations.

## Restrictions

 - Legendary Weapons innately inhibit each other's experience gain when in close proximity,forcing heroes to adventure individually. 

 - Restricted from equipping any weapon apart from the assigned (else be zapped). The assigned weapon will teleport to the user if removed. 

## Translate

 - Verbal language is translated to the user into their primary language, and the user can vocalize into their recipient's primary language. 

## Absorption

- Weapons can absorb loot, items, and materials to unlock new variations of themselves. The user can access new transformations provided they reach the level requirement. 

## Weapon transformation

 - Weapons can transform into different variations that grant the user new equip bonuses including stats, skills, and abilities. Variations can become mastered with enough experience, allowing the user to permanently retain the equip bonuses even if they switch transformations. Some bonuses remain exclusive.

## Weapon Copy

 - The user can copy variants they encounter and store them for later access. 

## Strengthening Method

 - Weapons have various strengthening methods that are selectively revealed to the user's interface. Other users can enable these systems only if they believe they exist. This sharing is accessible between Legendary Heroes and Vassal Wielders. 

## Wave Summon

 - The Legendary Heroes' parties are transported to the spawn of a Wave of Calamity, where they defeat the wave. 

## Curse Series

Legendary Weapons respond to the user's strong negative emotions, absorbing them to unlock the Curse variant. The Curse variant is unlocked when the owner of the weapon undergoes enough heavy strain through negative and traumatic events.

The Curse Series is suicide prevention for the Legendary Heroes. They grant powerful effects, stats bonuses, and abilities. But the users of the Curse Series always have to pay a heavy price when used.
