                                                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                                                </div>							            						
                                            </div>
                                            <p>Motoyasu is likely the friendliest of the four Legendary Heroes. It's mentioned that he is loyal to his allies. However, he is incredibly naive and gullible. He is generally a nice person; however, he's easily fooled by women. He will believe anything a woman says without any shred of evidence. When Malty framed Naofumi for rape, even though she had stolen his money and clothes both of which she gave to Motoyasu, he thoroughly believed her claims and became openly hostile towards Naofumi in her defense. </p>
                                            <p>He is a flirt and a skirt chaser who asks both Raphtalia and Filo to leave Naofumi and join his party the instant he meets each of them, but quick to admit Raphtalia was right to scold him for flirting with her when they were doing a party exchange. He seems to be incapable of believing any woman is capable of doing wrong or being evil, heartless, or manipulative. He later acts on his own in trying to save Raphtalia and Filo, without their consent, to free them from being Naofumi's slave. Raphtalia is quick to point out the flaw of his actions here.
                                            <p>He demonstrates high levels of self-delusion and willful ignorance, if not plain idiocy. He only hears what he wanted to hear and ignored whatever might upset him. Examples of this include his duel with Naofumi for Raphtalia's freedom, when he received a slap instead of a hug after he freed her from slavery and was called out for his hypocrisy, he defended himself desperately claiming that Naofumi must have brainwashed her. He also refused to believe Malty to have framed Naofumi, even after seeing all the evidence. He continued to believe in Malty and denied all of the reality.</p>
                                            <p>He doesn't accept a fight unless he is utterly confident of victory. His cocky challenges to Naofumi show this and that he does so twice.</p>
                                            <p>His personality turned completely 180 after he unlocked his Curse Series, developing an obsessive crush for Filo and starting to regard Naofumi with the utmost respect as his "father-in-law" (since he started to see both Filo and Raphtalia as Naofumi's "daughters"). At the same time, he changes from a skirt chaser to a Filolial lover, being unable to not see women as nothing but pigs and found disgusting their "reek" and enjoying spending his time surrounded by filolials. Additionally, his psyche was greatly warped to the point that he develops a fearless and bloodthirsty style of battle, without feeling any concerns about killing or being covered in blood</p>

                                                    <h3>Motoyasu's</h3>
                                                    <h2>Background</h2>
                                                </div>							            						
                                            </div>
                                                <p>Before being summoned to another world, Motoyasu was a University Student. Motoyasu was dating too many girls at a time and before he knew it, the situation got violent and he was stabbed to death. Because of this past trauma, he developed a phobia of violent women (yanderes).</p>
                                                <p>The full story was later revealed in the Spin-off Series where it wasn't the case of Motoyasu dating too many girls but him not being able to decide between two of them.</p>
                                                <p>Motoyasu had two female friends, Momiji, a shy and quiet girl, and Ikuyo, a bossy girl who was also one of Motoyasu's classmates, both of whom held feelings for him and ended up confessing their love towards him. When Ikuyo finally demanded Motoyasu choose one or the other, the latter chose to run away from the situation and derail the topic. Running out of patience and letting her temper get the better of her, Ikuyo grabbed a knife from the kitchen and pointed it toward Momiji, proclaiming if she was out of the picture, Motoyasu would be able to finally date her. Shocked by Ikuyo's sudden violent nature, Motoyasu ran over to stand between the two but ended up getting stabbed on the side of the chest not by Ikuyo, but by Momiji, who also had a knife in her hands.   </p>
                                                <p>Momiji, who was usually shy and quiet, started displaying yandere-like traits, stabbing Motoyasu out of fear that he was secretly visiting other girls besides herself and Ikuyo. She had developed the idea of dying with Motoyasu and being with him in the afterlife. Ikuyo, in a fit of jealousy, stabbed Motoyasu as well, declaring that if anyone was going to be with him in the afterlife, it was going be her. Motoyasu was repeatedly stabbed by both Momiji and Ikuyo, possibly dying from profuse blood loss.   </p>
                                                <p>He later found himself summoned to another world. The world reminded him of the game he played in his previous world, Emerald Online.</p></p>

                                                <h2>Trivia</h2>
                                                <p>It was visible to everyone that Motoyasu was trying to make a harem for himself. He tried to pick up girls everywhere he went to.</p>
                                                <p>His fighting style is that of fighting in the frontlines while his party members cheer him on in the background and rarely assist him with magic or whatever he could need in battle.</p>
                                                <p>He has the most shuffling of the party members. He doesn't care much about the male members of the party and gives special attention to only the females. It is likely the male members are disgusted with his flirting habits before leaving, while the females are kicked out by Malty. </p>
